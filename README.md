# Library-Management-Atheneum

Deploy link: https://master--athenaeum-the-library.netlify.app/

A library management app to easily maintain and show availability of books in the library. Readers can browse the library online and check availabilty of desired books without visiting the library. Librarians can easily update count of books available, add, search and delete books. The aim is to digitalise basic library functions and minimalise human effort. The search feature gives real-time results based on the book title/author so that the user need not know or type the full thing. In addition it displays the themes/tags associated with the book, rating and book description.
